    <h3>Prototype</h3>
    <p>
        The goal for my site is to make a pokemon finder that gives the user it's type and region, and also allows them to filter by that information as
        well. For the prototype, I worked the most on design and the API... the two things you do in fact need. The API was interesting to work with. The
        pokemon api does this thing where if you want a pokemons types, it grabs the pokemon type api and then gives it to you, instead of the type being
        stored directly into the regular pokemon api (if that makes sense...). The GIF Finder was definitely where I started for this project, and it's
        more noticeable in my initial build. 
    </p><br>
    <p>
        I'm not sure if this count as above and beyond but I'm really proud of the visual design. The filters look nice (they weren't done during 
        this phase, but still) and I was proud of the way the pokemon fade in upon load. I did use the GIF finder as a base for sure, and the shadow
        box on the results really worked in my favor. 
    </p>

    <h3>Critiques</h3>
    <p>
        By this point, I had pretty much everything done. The API was finished, so I wanted critiques on how to enhance the visuals. I got some good
        feedback on somewhat minor changes that is noticeable from the prototype to now.
    </p>

    <h3>Final</h3>
    <p>Overall fixed a lot of design issues. I didn't touch my js after the critiques, as people told me I didn't need
        much else. The search box looks so much better, as well as stays in a sort of pokemon aesthetic with red, yellow, and blue colors.
        I also changed the banner and put the header on the side rather than center aligned so that the banner didn't look messy, like it did
        in the prototype. I also changed the typography - I wanted to do the pokemon font, however I stuck to google fonts as 1 the pokemon font
        mightve been harder to read, and 2 I am not yet sure how to import fonts outside of google. Overall though I'm happy with the visuals for
        sure as I've mentioned maybe 5 times now... my bad</p>
