            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>Despite Everything, It's Still You.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A well known quote from an iconic game, Undertale irreversibly impacted the gaming community. Undertale is a small 
                indie game made by only a couple people, Toby Fox being the main director/producer. It's incredible story starts off
                with a human who falls into a place called the Underground, a place where monsters reside. The player then guides this
                human, and decides what their story is going to be throughout the gameplay. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Gameplay</h3>

            <p>There are many aspects to Undertale's gameplay. For the fighting mechanics, the player controls the human's soul, which
                is a heart shaped object that you can move around in fights with the arrow keys. The system is turn based - during the
                player's turn, they decide if they want to FIGHT, ACT, use an ITEM, or SPARE - either by showing MERCY or FLEEing. During
                the opponent's turn, they will attack the player, and the player must dodge the attacks to avoid damage. The controls of the
                game are that of any basic indie game controls - arrows to move, z to continue, x to pause. One of the most important aspects
                of this game is the saving and loading mechanics. To save the game, the player must interact with a star object that appears
                in certain areas of the game. The reason the saving and loading mechanic matters so much is because the game remembers when 
                the player does. For example, at the beginning of the game, the first boss is a monster named Toriel, who takes the player in 
                and guides them through the ruins. If they kill her and then reset the game to spare her, the very first character they are 
                introduced to remembers and taunts them for it. There are also puzzles throughout the game that the player must complete to
                continue through the story or unlock little secrets, that are both fun and gets the player to think.

            </p>
            <h3>Story</h3>

            <p>As mentioned before, the story follows a human and their journey through the Underground as the player guides their actions
                to determine the ending the human will have. There are 3 routes in this game: the Neutral route, the Pacifist route, and the
                Genocide route. The Neutral route is the sort of "default" ending, that happens if you kill some monsters you encounter but 
                spare others. The player will get this ending first if they try to attempt the Pacifist route. The Pacifist route is only
                available if the player does not kill a single monster. Once the player gets the neutral ending, the character they met at the
                start, Flowey the Flower, tells them that there's more to the story - and something the player can do to achieve it. The player
                must go back to a character they previously met named Alphys, and learn her story to achieve the Pacifist ending. Once that is done,
                the full story of Undertale is revealed through the final boss. Last, there's the Genocide ending, which is exactly as it sounds -
                this ending is achieved by killing every single monster in the game. Back when the game first came out, many were confused on how to
                even start this ending. Once the player is given free reigns in the ruins, they must run around to intentionally start fights with the
                monsters to kill them. The player must do this before reaching Toriel's home, and keep killing monsters until they encounter a fight
                that starts with "but nobody came." Once this route is started, to get the full ending, the player must keep killing monsters until
                there are none left in each area.
                <br><br>
                On top of the detailed and intricate story of this game, there's also loveable and unique characters that the player meets as the 
                story goes on. The most well known character even outside of Undertale is a character named Sans. Each character in the game has
                a story to tell, and really draws the player to them. The story of Undertale was so impactful due to its well written nature and
                the fact that the player's choice <strong>matters.</strong> Undertale was revolutionary in its time, as it was one of the first
                indie games to directly talk to the player as well as show them the consequences of their actions. This isn't just a story about
                the characters the player meets, but a story that the player creates.

            <h3>Development of the Game</h3>
            <p>Undertale was a small project started by 1 person - Toby Fox. It was completely funded through a Kickstarter campaign and took
                ~2.7 years to make. Undertale was created when Toby Fox had little to no game development experience so... the code is bad. 
                Not that that matters anyway. The development of this game is a fascinating story to follow, as it starts with some guy who had
                an idea, sketched some things in his college notebook, and composed a few songs. For something that started off in this way to
                garner the attention it has and live on for coming up on 10 years now is an inspiration to create.
            </p>
            <h3>Community</h3>
            <p>As mentioned above, the Undertale community has been going on strong for almost 10 years now. The fandom is both famous
                and well... infamous. Personally, it was the first true fandom I ever laid my eyes on. To dive more into my personal 
                connection to Undertale, this game was the first to tell me that I wanted to create. If I never came across a small YouTube
                video demoing the game, I don't know if I would've gotten into game design. Toby Fox's story is such a huge inspiration,
                knowing that I can create whenever I want - and start with some sketches in my notebook and an idea.
