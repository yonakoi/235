    <h3>Phase 1</h3>
    <p>
        The goal for my site is honestly to infodump about undertale... half joking. The goal really is to show my love for Undertale however, and I 
        want my design and organization to show that. As for audience, I'd say fellow indie game lovers, or anyone who needs convincing to play 
        undertale :))
    </p><br>
    <p>
        I don't believe I went above and beyond as I didn't really know HOW to... during phase 2 of the project, that's when I really want to 
        experiment. Especially with fonts, colors, different formatting, etc. I won't change my grid style, but I may experiment with different ways
        to do it (such as adding rows... just some food for thought). I did use our old grid demo as a sort of starting point, but I want to be able
        to format it as I wish. I am using Phase 1 as a way to simply create a skeleton and a basis.

    <h3>Prototype</h3>
    <p>
        My goal for this phase was to bullet the info I plan to put into the page and overall finalize the set up. After this period, I'll work
        more on the nav and the rest of the elements needed for this project. Unfortunately I had a hard time this week so I'm glad I at least have
        enough to work off of in terms of design critique and maybe advice on what I can add (besides the required stuff).

    <h3>Phase 2</h3>
    <p>Overall fixed a lot of design issues to make it more consistent. I'm happy with the product :)</p>
