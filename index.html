                <br>
                <br>
                I'm a second year at RIT majoring in Game Design & Development. I like playing and making games, whether it's the artistic aspect, coding, or story
                writing! I also like to make video edits and play piano in my free time. I hope this class will help me understand website design to make compelling websites,
                whether it's for merchandise for future products, or websites to showcase my projects. When I graduate, I hope I can go back to my roots aka California because
                many of my loved ones are in the West, and I think it'd be easier to phase into being independant as time goes on. I also have a cat named Apollo and I do think
                that's necessary information that you need to know
            </p>
