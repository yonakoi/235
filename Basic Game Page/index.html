        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p><em>Dig Dug</em> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping
        you from doing this are two monsters, called <strong>Pooka</strong> and <strong>Fygar</strong>, <br>who will continually chase you around. The only weapon
        that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]</p>
